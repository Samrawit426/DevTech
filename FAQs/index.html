        <div class="faq-question">What is a black hole?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so
          strong that nothing can escape from it, not even light. This
          phenomenon occurs when a massive star collapses under its own gravity
          after it has exhausted its nuclear fuel.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Why is it called a "black" hole?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          It is called a "black" hole because it absorbs all light that falls
          into it and does not reflect any light back, making it invisible
          against the backdrop of space.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How does a black hole form?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Black holes form when a massive star runs out of nuclear fuel and
          undergoes gravitational collapse. The outer layers are expelled, while
          the core collapses, leading to the formation of a black hole.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">
          What happens if something gets too close to a black hole?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          When an object approaches a black hole, it experiences extreme
          gravitational forces. This effect can stretch the object vertically
          and compress it horizontally, a process known as "spaghettification,"
          resulting in the object being torn apart.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can black holes be detected?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, black holes can be detected indirectly by observing the effects
          of their gravity on nearby stars and gas. When material falls into a
          black hole, it emits X-rays that can be detected by telescopes.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is the event horizon?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The event horizon is the boundary surrounding a black hole. Once an
          object crosses this boundary, it cannot escape the black hole's
          gravitational pull, marking the point of no return.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is Hawking radiation?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Hawking radiation is a theoretical prediction by physicist Stephen
          Hawking that suggests black holes can emit radiation due to quantum
          effects near the event horizon, which implies that black holes can
          lose mass over time.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">
          Are there different types of black holes?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, there are primarily three types of black holes: stellar black
          holes, which form from collapsing stars; supermassive black holes,
          which reside at the centers of galaxies; and intermediate black holes,
          which are theorized to form from the merging of smaller black holes.
